Super Ultra Mega Professional VOXEL format spec, lol

Voxel models:
* Have a version number for the VOXEL format
* Have a cubic size from 1 to 256 (values 0..255)
* Have a scale at which they are drawn in the world, from 1 to 256 (values 0..255)
* Have a root location denoting the "center" of the object. When drawing a voxel model at (1, 1, 1), the model's root location will be at (1, 1, 1)
* Have a list of no more than 255 colors for voxels
* Have a cubic array of indices, either 0 (nonexistant) or 1..255 (index into materials list)

Version 0:

[byte] version (always 0)
[byte] number of colors
[byte] one less than the cubic size of the model (values 0..255 becone sizes 1..256)
[byte] the scale of the model in the world

[float] the X position of the root location
[float] the Y position of the root location
[float] the Z position of the root location

number of colors * {
	[float] the red value of the color
	[float] the green value of the color
	[float] the blue value of the color
}

size^3 * {
	[byte] index into materials list (or 0 for no voxel)
}

The size of a version 0 file, in bytes, will always be 16 + 12*num_colors + size^3. The largest possible file, with 255 colors and a 256x256x256 grid, is ~16MB (16780292 bytes).

Version 0 notes:

* Colors could be stored 4x as efficiently as bytes rather than floats. Not a huge issue, since the color array will never be significantly large (765 bytes for a model with 255 colors - for comparison, a 9*9*9 index array takes up 729 bytes).
